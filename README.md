![Wireframe Image](./wireframes_projects.png)


Notes:</br>
(1) I have setup the Repository on GitHub.</br>
(2) I have installed and created the cors on my back-end repo project.</br>
(3) I have created a wireframe and planned my components, note: Authentication is going to be one of the last things I do on the project.</br>
(4) I created a button that outputs the API data to screen on another page, viewing a list of all articles.</br>
(5) I created a page that allows views of an individual article when the link is pressed.</br>
(6) I added CSS (mobile first) to the code.</br>
(7) I implemented the list of comments associated with each article in the API. I added code to the ArticlesDetails file including a new API to fetch the comments. I then created a map to loop through the API.</br>
(8) I used bootstrap to design a card for each article.</br>
(9) I implemented code into ArticlesDetails that incremented a count in the console and on the screen.</br>
(10) I implemented the code from the basic counter into the ArticlesDetails page. Moreover, I added the API via patch. </br>
(11) I added the about me and contact pages to the site, I also created the CSS for both pages. </br>
(12) I added code to the Articles page to display a message saying 'Loading Articles, Please wait...', I did this using a isLoading state and adding a finally statement after the catch code. Lastly, I added a small 'if statement':  if (isLoading) { return Loading Articles, Please wait...; } </br>
<13> I updated the ArticlesDetails page to include a delete function to delete comments on the page.</br>
