![Wireframe Image](./wireframes_projects.png)


Notes:</br>
(1) I have setup the Repository on GitHub.</br>
(2) I have installed and created the cors on my back-end repo project.</br>
(3) I have created a wireframe and planned my components, note: Authentication is going to be one of the last things I do on the project.</br>
(4) I created a button that outputs the API data to screen on another page, viewing a list of all articles.</br>
(5) I created a page that allows views of an individual article when the link is pressed.</br>
(6) I added CSS (mobile first) to the code.</br>
(7) I implemented the list of comments associated with each article in the API. I added code to the ArticlesDetails file including a new API to fetch the comments. I then created a map to loop through the API.</br>
(8) I used bootstrap to design a card for each article.</br>
