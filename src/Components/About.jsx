       <p>I am enamored to be part of the exceptional experience provided by the Northcoders bootcamp. 
        This program has been instrumental in my journey toward becoming a junior React developer. 
        It has not only boosted my confidence, but also significantly enhanced my technical skills.<br /><br /> 
        I'm currently working on a REACT application, the apps' main purpose is to retrieve articles 
        from a database which I created using PostgreSQL, and displaying the articles using an API.
