This program has been instrumental in my journey toward becoming a junior React developer. It has not only boosted my confidence, but also significantly enhanced my technical skills.<br /><br /> I am currently independently developing a React application that retrieves articles from a PostgreSQL database, 
            which I designed and implemented as part of the backend. The application allows users to view and 
            interact with individual articles, including features for reading comments and voting on articles. </div>
