       <p>I am enamored to be part of the exceptional experience provided by the Northcoders bootcamp. 
        This program has been instrumental in my journey toward becoming a junior React developer. 
        It has not only boosted my confidence, but also significantly enhanced my technical skills.<br /><br /> 
        I am currently independently developing a React application that retrieves articles from a PostgreSQL database, 
        which I designed and implemented as part of the backend. The application allows users to view and 
        interact with individual articles, including features for reading comments and voting on articles.
